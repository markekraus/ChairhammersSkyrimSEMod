This mod requires [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/)

### Load Order

This mod can be installed in any order.

## User Guide

Chairhammers can be crafted at a blacksmith's forge using the same materials as normal warhammers of the same type. They can also be upgraded at Grindstones.

Chairhammers are equipped like normal warhammers and are used the same as well.

Chairhammers can also be bought from blacksmiths and any other vendors that normally sell warhammers.

Enemies may also be armed with Chairhammers. They may attack you with them or you may find them on their dead bodies.

Chairhammers may also be found in chests.

## Compatibility

If you have [Sentient Chairs of Skyrim (SCOS)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59604), this mod is redundant. you can still install it if you wish. You will have chair warhammers from both mods with different names. It may also skew the percentage of chair warhammers that spawn as the both update the same leveled lists.

This mod should be compatible with everything.

This mod has scripted compatibility with [Valdacil's Item Sorting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5224). No patch is required.

## Warning: Not Lore-friendly

This mod is technically not lore-friendly because chair weapons are silly.
